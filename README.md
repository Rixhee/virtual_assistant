# Introduction 

<h3> 
    This is my final project for Harvard CS50x course. I have tried to create Jarvis, who is basically iron man's virtual assistant(like Siri and Alexa). I created this project using the programming language Python. 
<h3> 
<br> 

# What all he can do

<h3>
    You can ask Jarvis the time and date, he can search something on Google, Youtube, and wikipedia for you and can open any website on Google. 
</h3>
<br>

# Usage

<h3>
    All you have to do is run the program, First Jarvis wishes you good morning, good afternoon or good evening according to the time and then he would start listening to whatever you are saying after a second. If you want to stop the program, you have to say goodbye or goodnight.
